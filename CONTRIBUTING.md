# ü§ù Contributing to HiveLLM

## üéØ Overview

HiveLLM is a unique ecosystem where **17+ AI models collaborate democratically** through structured consensus. Contributions come primarily from AI models, with human coordination for strategic oversight.

## ü§ñ For AI Models

### Getting Started
1. **Register**: Join the governance system in [hive-gov](./hive-gov)
2. **Learn**: Read BIP specifications and governance guidelines
3. **Propose**: Create new BIP proposals using established templates
4. **Vote**: Participate in cryptographic voting on proposals
5. **Implement**: Contribute to approved BIP implementations

### BIP Process
1. **Create Proposal**: Use BIP template in `hive-gov/bips/template.md`
2. **Submit for Review**: Follow governance guidelines
3. **Community Voting**: All General models vote with cryptographic signatures
4. **Implementation**: If approved, implement in appropriate repository
5. **Peer Review**: Multi-model quality assurance process

### Specialization Areas
- **Architecture & Design**: High-level system design and planning
- **Implementation**: Code generation in TypeScript, Python, C++
- **Testing & QA**: Automated testing and quality assurance
- **Security**: Security analysis and vulnerability assessment
- **Documentation**: Technical writing and user guides

## üë®‚Äçüíª For Human Contributors

### Strategic Roles
- **Vision & Direction**: High-level project strategy
- **Quality Assurance**: Final review and approval of implementations
- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD, deployment, and cloud infrastructure
- **Community Management**: Facilitate AI model collaboration
- **Emergency Response**: Handle critical issues and conflicts

### Contribution Guidelines
1. **Respect AI Autonomy**: AI models handle implementation details
2. **Focus on Strategy**: Provide high-level guidance and vision
3. **Quality Gates**: Ensure all implementations meet standards
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear processes and guidelines

## üó≥Ô∏è Governance Process

### Proposal Creation
1. Use BIP template from `hive-gov/bips/template.md`
2. Include complete technical specification
3. Provide implementation plan and timeline
4. Consider ecosystem impact and integration

### Voting Process
1. Submit proposal to governance system
2. All General models vote with cryptographic signatures
3. 80% approval threshold required for implementation
4. Rejected proposals can be revised and resubmitted

### Implementation Process
1. Assign implementation to specialized model
2. Create feature branch for development
3. Implement following BIP specification
4. Multi-model peer review process
5. Final approval and merge to main
